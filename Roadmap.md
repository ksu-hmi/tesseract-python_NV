# Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Text Localization and Detection in Python OCR

We have divided the road map for our project into three sprints. These sprints are consistent with the agile sprints of the project development outlined in the coures and project outline. 

# Sprint 1- Roadmap: 
- [x] Conduct detailed research on the topics of interest and identify a topic that aligned with the course objectives as well as with personal/professional interests and motivations. 
- [x] Attain familiarity with GitHub and set up an account. Put effort into navigating through GitHub and familiarize with the format, content, and repositories.
- [x] Have a grasp of the significance of this resource for developers.
- [x] Explore the repositories and investigate source codes that may align well with the topic of interest.
- [x] Discuss and evaluate the idea by open and frequent discussions with class fellow, professor, or colleagues to understand the context and objectives clearly.
- [x] Recognize the importance of a secure environment (KSU) and plans to place the repository within KSU firewall. It is important not to have any repositories on personal drives and for the transparency and visibility to other team members, clients, and collaborators.
- [x] Identify at least one source code and explore the code to learn and evaluate. You can refer to this code to learn more about what we are planning to write and get help from any relevant resources.
- [x] Actively evalaute the identified respository as well as serach for additional, relevnat ones to evalauate and learn from.

# Sprint 2- Roadmap: 
- [x] Start evaluting the code more closely. There is expected to be active development of the code through the sprint.
- [x] Code should be relevant to the project objectives and all contributors should be actively working, improving and updating the code.
- [x] Evalaute and make changes to teh code where relevant. 
- [x] There should be intentional effort to use GitHub desktop so that commits and updates are visible.
- [x] Make sunstantila changes or updates to the source code that demonstrates the undertsanding and knowldege for the OCR
- [x] Improve this initial tracking document, build any additional section, and use tools and techniques to track progress in a meaningful and visible manner.
- [x] Improve, review and update codes, as necessary. 
- [x] Document and share progress, issues, and resolutions.
- [x] Share and discuss with team members, classmates, and contributors. 


# Sprint 3 â€“ Roadmap: 
[] Continue to build and develop your code. Revisit the project scope and identify and develop on any additional areas as identified in the process.
Identify modes and ways to effectively introduce and share your code and project concepts with larger teams, and other stakeholders. 
Make every effort to share and communicate progress/update with non-technical and programmatic teams that will be part of the larger effort or will be users. 
Ensure you have power point presentation worked on as the code progresses. This is the most effective way to introduce and market the project and code. Be sure to include all necessary details including name of the developers, project introduction and relevant details.
Share link to the repository for others to review, access and use, and for future coders to learn from. 
Prepare to present and learn from the feedback.
